## Here's a lovely, and dynamic weather dashboard. Some of the features will provide the following:

- Ability to search for cities which presents current and future conditions for that city via a 5 day forecast!

- Saves data entered for quick reference.

- When viewing specific cities you are able to view various weather coditions ranging from basic temperature all the way to viewing the UV Index which the colors scale depending on the severity.
